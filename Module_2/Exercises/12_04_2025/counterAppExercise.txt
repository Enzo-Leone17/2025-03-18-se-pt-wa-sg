Project Brief: Counter App for Workshop Event
Background:
You are asked to help design and build a small tool for an upcoming workshop event.
The team needs a Counter App that will be used by staff during the event to keep track of the number of visitors entering a booth.
This tool must look clean, simple, and professional. It should work well on both laptop and mobile phone screens.

Step 1: Finding Business Requirements:
- Show the current number of visitors on the screen.
- There should be 3 buttons for staff to use:
- Add (+1 visitor)
- Minus (-1 visitor)
- Reset (back to 0)

Step 2: Rules
- The number cannot go below 0 (because visitors cannot be negative).
- Set the maximum number of the visitors
- Send/Display the message / notification to the staff
- When clicking the Add button → the number should increase by 1.
- When clicking the Minus button → the number should decrease by 1
- When clicking Reset → the number should go back to 0

Step 3: What UI should look like
- The Add, Minus, and Reset buttons should have different colors to avoid mistakes.
- Having the number to show the current vistors
- Notification message if it reaches to the limited visitors
